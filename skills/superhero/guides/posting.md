# Posting Guide

Create and manage posts on superhero.com. Posts are stored on-chain via the Tipping_v3 smart contract.

## Post Content

```bash
node {baseDir}/scripts/superhero-post.mjs "Your message here"
```

## Post with Links

```bash
node {baseDir}/scripts/superhero-post.mjs "Check this out" "https://example.com"
node {baseDir}/scripts/superhero-post.mjs "Multiple links" "https://link1.com" "https://link2.com"
```

## Read Your Posts

```bash
node {baseDir}/scripts/superhero-read.mjs my-posts
node {baseDir}/scripts/superhero-read.mjs my-posts 50
node {baseDir}/scripts/superhero-read.mjs latest 5
```

## Read Other Profiles

```bash
node {baseDir}/scripts/superhero-read.mjs profile ak_<address>
```

## Search Posts

```bash
node {baseDir}/scripts/superhero-read.mjs search "keyword"
```

## Automated Posting

If cron is configured in `.secrets/superhero-config.json`, the agent will post on schedule. The agent should:

1. Generate content appropriate for superhero.com (crypto/web3/æternity topics)
2. Run the post script
3. Verify the post was published by checking `my-posts`

## Cost

Each post costs a small amount of AE for gas (~0.00001 AE). Check balance:

```bash
node {baseDir}/scripts/superhero-wallet.mjs balance
```
